# Create three vectors of different types (any data type is fine) and of length 6. Save them as separate objects.

# Combine the three vectors into a data frame named my_df

# Save the value from the 3rd row, 2nd column to a new object named my_object.

# Create another vector of length 6 (any data type is fine), and add it to your data frame.
