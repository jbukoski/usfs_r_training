## Exercise 1

# You collected data on one plot today. We need to compile the data in R for analysis.

# There were 5 trees: 	pine, pine, walnut, walnut, alder
# The heights were: 	100, 75, 120, 90, 50
# The tree status was: 	live, live, live, dead, live

# 1.1  Create a vector with 5 elements of tree names and assign it to an object named 'tree'.

# 1.2  Display the number of elements in the tree vector?

# 1.3  What is the mode of the tree vector?

# 1.4  Display the .number of elements in the tree vector that are "walnut".

# 1.5  Create a vector with 5 elements of tree heights and assign it to an object named 'ht'.

# 1.6  What is the mode of the ht vector?

# 1.7  What is the maximum height of all 5 trees?..   what is the average height?

# 1.8  Create another vector of 5 elements with tree status and assign to an object named 'status'.

# 1.9  What is the mode of 'status'?

# 1.10 Change 'status' to a factor with 2 levels, 1:live; 2:dead and assign back to object 'status'.

# 1.11  Create a data frame object named 'treesdf', with the 3 vectors you just made, 
#       'tree', 'ht', and 'status'.

# 1.12  What are the dimensions of treesdf?

# 1.13  What are the column names of treesdf?

# 1.14  What does the structure of treesdf look like?

# 1.15  You missed a tree. It was a dead pine tree with height of 30 meters. 
#       Add it to treesdf and assign this new data frame to on object named 'treesdf2'.

# 1.16  Save the object, treesdf2 to a file in your workspace named 'treesdf2.csv'.
